Today, world is going through the pandemic crisis, lockdown is imposed in whole country so it is difficult to attend physical classes. Also, there are the tools present to connect virtually but lacks some features to collaborate more effectively. Few tools support online learning with video conferencing but don’t have dashboard. Few apps have dashboard but miss chat online and video conferencing feature. Smarto addressed this problem and designed Smart Board where people can share workspace, chat online, connect on video to learn together remotely in real time.  

Multiple people can work together on single board. Write, update, and delete any type of content on the board. All the collaborating members can see the changes live on their screen. The board is so responsive that it feels natural to draw and sketch the way you would on a traditional whiteboard. Grab images and content from the web and bring them straight into your board; pull in work from Docs, Sheets, and Slides; even add photos stored in Drive. Smart Board enables users to connect the entire workspace. Students can explore ideas using the digital whiteboard to create freehand sketches, draw and collect feedback from teachers in real time.

## FAQs 
1. How can I start using Smartboard? 
Once you set up an account and begin using Smartboard, you get a dashboard, which you see whenever you first log in. It's the place where you find all your boards as well as folders for organizing them. The app also suggests videos that can show how to use all its features.
2. Can I use Smartboard on any screens?
Smartboard is available on the web, as a Windows app, and as Android and iOS apps. While you can use Smartboard on a smartphone, we don't necessarily recommend it. Smartboard and other visual collaboration apps work best when you have a larger screen, and so while you might interact and view boards from a tablet, doing so from a phone won't give you a great experience.
3. How to keep my smartboard safe? 
You can set up access who can view and edit your Smartboard. Only people having the write access to your smartboard can make the changes on board. You can see the changes made by other people and if you want you can revert those changes.

You can chat online, and use video conferencing feature to give feedback in real time.

5. As a teacher how should I use this tool?
Use Smartboard as you would any whiteboard app. Teachers can share their Smartboard with students for collaborative whole-class discussions.
You can assign a project, have students begin to collaborate using Smartboard. Students can work together using video conferencing so that they can talk through ideas as they map them.

## Internal FAQs 
1. What will customers like most about Smartboard? 
Smartboard has been a great solution for students and teachers since they have all been learning virtually from home during the pandemic. They like to use Smartboard because it makes class interactive and fun! Also they can see others faces and asks doubts while learning it more feels like a classroom.

2. What will customers like least about Smartboard? 
Smartboard free version comes with only 3 whiteboard. They want more free whiteboards.

3. What are the concerns with this product? 
Smartboard works like slides instead of an infinite page, which can lose the sequence or relationship of the notes. It would be good if the developers added tools to interact with the images on the board and select the objects, also add more fonts and a color palette.

4. How do we compare to our competitors? 
Our biggest competitor is Google’s Jamboard.  It is excellent for situations where you are collaborating with the work team, as it is integrated with Google classroom, then it is just a matter of integrating or presenting the whiteboard. But the UI is not great as the actual area for working is small due to large headers like other usual applications- Google sheets, Google docs, etc. Our smart board has a flexibility to resize so we have an edge here over Jamboard.
