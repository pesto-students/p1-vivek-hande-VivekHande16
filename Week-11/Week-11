Sort an array in wave form with following requirements : 


1. Takes input an array of numbers. 
2. The numbers in the input array can be negative, positive, decimal and in any order.
3. Returns the array Re arrange numbers in the array as follows : a1 <= a2 >= a3 <= a4 >= ....
4. If multiple operations are required can have a common function to reuse them
5. Time complexity (Big O notation) of your solution
6. Space complexity (Big O notation) of your solution
7. List all possible test cases
8. Sample Input : [10, -90, 49, 2.0, 1, 5, 23];
9. Sample Output : [ -90 , 49,  2.0 , 10 , 1 , 23 , 5]
